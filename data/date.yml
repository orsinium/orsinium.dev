      I do a bit of everything. I play piano, write music, listen to music,
      doodle sketches, cut things from wood, go to gym, go bouldering, read books,
      watch movies, play games, write games, play board games and TTRPGs,
      speak at conferences, and much more. My day is 48 hours long.

      I go to places, I see people, and I'm not afraid to try new things.
      I'm not a club guy, though: I'd always pick a one-to-one deep conversation
      with a signle person rather than a crowded party.
  - name: Tinkerer

      I'm a software engineer. I'm very good at it and I enjoy doing it.
      I read techy books, create lots of programs and tools, automate boring stuff,
      and write code just for fun. My tinkering isn't just about a code, it's my life.
      If I see a mechanism I've never seen before (like a drawbridge),
      I must know how it works.

      I left a boring steady income job to join a friend's startup
      ([OurMind](https://ourmind.ai/)) and to start my own
      ([Firefly Zero](https://fireflyzero.com/)). Life isn't about earning as much money
      as possible. Life is about being remembered for great things.

      Magic is real and telepathy exists. I'm fascinated about human brain, body,
      and psychology. Every person to me is a universe. I read books, go through courses,
      and put my skills to the test. I can read thoughts, notice little behavior details,
      and I can tell about you more than you know yourself.
      I want to help everyone to discover themselves and their purpose in life.

      I've been with the same partner for 11 years. And I never betrayed her trust.
      I won't lie to you and I will keep all your secrets.
