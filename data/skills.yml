        I'm in love with Go. It has quite a different philosophy
        rather than Python, and it's great. I've started to use it about 2 years ago

    - name: DS and ML
      info: >
        At the university, I worked in the linguistic department
        where I researched language and text influence,
        adopted Claude Shannon's information theory to natural languages.
        In Cindicator I wrote simple trading strategies that get
        information from crypto exchanges and make predictions
        about cryptocurrencies prices. On free time I learn
        Machine Learning and build different cool models.
        See [my projects](projects.html#ds-and-ml) for examples.

        At my free time I do [data analysis](projects.html#ds-and-ml)
