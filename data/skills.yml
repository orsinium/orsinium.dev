        This is my favorite language, I've been in it since version 3.4 (2014).
        I know the source code of almost all stdlib, have many Python-based
        Open Source [projects](./projects.html) and public talks, always
        can pick the best library for any task.

      info: >
        I'm quite proficient with Go. I reach to it when I need a good performance:
        games, small systems (thanks to TinyGo), CLI tools, and small but important APIs.
        Oh, and of course I have [some open-source projects](./projects.html) on Go.
        I work with Go since version 1.11 (2018).
    - name: Elixir

        I enjoy Elixir and believe it's the best functional language.
        I know some good of chunk of Erlang, have experience with a basic web app on
        Phoenix with LiveView, understand Erlang concurrency, know some parts of OTP,
        and eager to dive deeper into this beautiful ecosystem.

      info: >
        I'm pretty fluent with HTML, CSS, and even the quirks of WebAPI.
        I might miss some modern features like flexbox, though.
        Mostly, because Bootstrap is sufficient for my projects and it
        abstracts away some markup complexity.

        With modern JS I'm less familiar.
        Mostly, I use for my projects AlpineJS, WASM, and LiveView.
        If you need a frontend developer, it's not me. But if you need from me just
        a good understanding of your frontend, I can easily crack it.
    - name: More!
      info: >
        I believe that every programming language has some beautiful ideas,
        and I like learning new ones. I have experience with Rust, Haskell, Gleam,
        Idris, RPython, Pony, Nim, Crystal, Clojure, Scala, JS, Ruby, and many other
        languages. I'm not afraid to read and fix code written in any language.

        Distributed systems are hard because of the very nature of our world
        (damn you, speed of light!), and I enjoy cracking this complexity.
        I'm familiar with fundamental problems, design patterns, algorithms,
        formal verification techniques and tools (TLA+ and Alloy 6),
        and just in general can design reliable solutions and consider
        all possible corner cases.

        Automated testing (unit, integration, acceptance, regression),
        static code analysis, formal verification,
        contract programming, mutation tests, and type theory.
        I like to push the boundaries of my code to see how it performs in extreme
        situations, to find interesting corner cases, and to dive into the math behind programming.

        At the university, I worked in the linguistics department
        where I researched language and text influence,
        adopted Claude Shannon's information theory to natural languages.
        In Cindicator I wrote simple trading strategies that get
        information from crypto exchanges and make predictions
        about cryptocurrencies prices. In my free time I learn
        Machine Learning and build different cool models.

        This is the most popular web framework. An old, a little bit slow, but beautiful.
        So I know it is very good, but I prefer to use faster alternatives like
        [Sanic](https://github.com/huge-success/sanic). It's more modern and fast.
    - name: Django REST Framework

        Also, I have [public talk](./projects.html) about it.
    - name: SQLAlchemy
      info: >
        It can't scare me. In Cindicator and EclecticIQ we have tons

        I can handle it, debug and optimize queries, work with
        Flask-SQLAlchemy and SQLAlchemy-mixins.
    - name: Pandas

        In Smena I built a really fast and effective report system
        on the top of pandas. In Cindicator I wrote the trading platform
        and strategies that process all the data using the pandas power.
        In my free time, I do [data analysis](projects.html#ds-and-ml)
        and it always first of all means working with pandas and charts.
