  First of all, thank you for your consideration. Job hunting is like dating.
  We're both looking for a perfect match. You to fill in a position with someone
  smart and friendly, I to join a team where I'll fit.
  So, let's try to learn about each other as much as we can before any commitments.
  Below are some of my expectations from my job, current or future.
items:
  - name: üá≥üá± visa
    info: >
      I need **Dutch visa sponsorship**. Check if your company is in
      [the public registry](https://ind.nl/en/documents/06-2022/publicregisterregularlabourandhighlyskilledmigrants.pdf).
      If it's not, I can't work for you.
  - name: üß† knowledge domain
    info: >
      I'm a principal software engineer and my career is focused on **solving difficult
      technical issues**, like distributed, real-time, high-scale, and high-complexity systems.
      If all you have is a small web application, I won't fit into your team.
      I'll be bored, and you will pay for a more expensive engineer than you actually need.
  - name: üîß languages
    info: >
      I write in **Python, Go, and Elixir**. I can time-to-time dig into codebase in any language
      you have but I won't enjoy writing on PHP or JS regularly.
  - name: üíé values
    info: >
      The thing I value the most is **passionate and smart software engineers** around me,
      who know the cost of complexity and want to deliver a high-quality product.
  - name: üè¢ office vs remote
    info: >
      I prefer a flexible approach with a **focus on the remote**. I come into the office
      when I know I need to talk to someone in person. In all other cases, I work from home.
      At home, I'm more productive, and focused, save a lot of time and energy on my commute,
      and still can call people if needed. I'm open for 100% remote positions too.
  - name: üíµ salary
    info: >
      The more the merrier. I expect **fair compensation that matches my skills and experience**,
      so I feel strange when I'm asked how much I want. Since the market changes rapidly
      and your interview might be the first one I had in a while, I might not know yet
      how much exactly this is.
  - name: ü§ù recruiting agencies
    info: >
      I can work with third-party agencies, but please, **tell me upfront** what companies
      you hire for. Even before we had the first call. Let's value our time. I promise not
      to apply to them past you and not sell this sacred knowledge to anyone.
  - name: üïµ learn more
    info: >
      The best place to learn about me is **my website** ([orsinium.dev](https://orsinium.dev/))
      which lists most of my open-source projects, skills, and work experience.
      I also have [CV](./cv.html) but it's just an abridged version of the website.

  - name: üìû contact
    info: >
      Now, you know a bit about what I expect. Do you think you know a place where I fit?
      Then let's talk about you! The best way to contact me is **by email**:
      [gram@orsinium.dev](mailto:gram@orsinium.dev). I'll be waiting for you ‚ô•Ô∏è
