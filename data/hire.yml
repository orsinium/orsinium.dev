  First of all, thank you for your consideration. Job hunting is like dating.
  We're both looking for a perfect match. You to fill in a position with someone
  smart and friendly, I to join a team where I'll fit.
  So, let's try to learn about each other as much as we can before any commitments.
  Below are some of my expectations from my job, current or future.
items:
  - name: visa
    info: >
      I need **Dutch visa sponsorship**. Check if your company is in
      [the public registry](https://ind.nl/en/Documents/Public_Register_Regular_Labour_and_Highly_Skilled_Migrants.pdf).
      If it's not, I can't work for you.
  - name: knowledge domain
    info: >
      I'm a senior software engineer and my career is focused on **solving difficult
      technical issues**, like distributed, real-time, high-scale, and high-complexity systems.
      If all you have is a small web application, I won't fit into your team.
      I'll be bored, and you will pay for a more expensive engineer than you actually need.
  - name: languages
    info: >
      I write in **Python, Go, and Elixir**. I can time-to-time dig into codebase in any language
      you have but I won't enjoy writing on PHP or JS regularly.
  - name: values
    info: >
      The things I value the most are **passionate and smart software engineers** around me,
      who know the cost of complexity and want to deliver a high-quality product.
  - name: office vs remote
    info: >
      I prefer a flexible approach with a **focus on the remote**. I come into the office
      when I know I need to talk to someone in person. In all other cases, I work from home.
      At home, I'm more productive, and focused, save a lot of time and energy on my commute,
      and still can call people if needed.
  - name: test assignment
    info: >
      I'll do a test assignment **only if you pay for it** with a rate matching what you pay
      your engineers. I'm a senior engineer and I value my time. If you want to see my code,
      I have [100+ open-source projects](./projects.html). If you want to see something specific,
      ask me on an interview.
  - name: salary
    info: >
      I want to earn as much as possible, and my financial goals are far from being exhausted.
      So, it doesn't make sense to ask how much I want. Let's talk about how much is fair.
      Fair compensation is **how much other companies are ready to pay for my skills**.
      To know my skills, you have interviews. To know the market, you have your experience
      as a recruiter. The market changes rapidly, so no, I don't know yet how much I'm worth.
  - name: learn more
    info: >
      The best place to learn about me is **my website** ([orsinium.dev](https://orsinium.dev/))
      which lists most of my open-source projects, skills, and work experience.
  - name: contact
    info: >
      Now, you know a bit about what I expect. Do you think you know a place where I fit?
      Then let's talk about you! The best way to contact me is **by email**:
      [gram@orsinium.dev](mailto:gram@orsinium.dev). I'll be waiting for you <3
